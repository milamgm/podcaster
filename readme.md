# podcaster
Welcome to the repository for Podcaster, a search and podcast player app!

This project was developed using Vite, a high-speed and lightweight build tool that's ideal for build react applications.

To launch the app in development mode, use the command <b>npm run dev</b>, and to generate the production build, run <b>npm run build</b>. The build command will produce a .dist folder that can be deployed by executing the <b>npm run deploy</b> command.

Some libraries were utilized to deliver the app's capabilities, including <b>react-router-dom</b> for client-side routing, <b>dompurify</b> for neutralizing malicious scripts, and <b>axios</b> for handling HTTP requests.

In addition to these features, the app's codebase is completely typed using TypeScript and the styles for the app were crafted using SASS.
